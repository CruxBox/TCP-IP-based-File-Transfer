# TCP-IP-based-File-Transfer-Program

Simple file transfer program using C sockets.
If no server address is provided the program assumes the server to be on the localhost.

# Arguments for server.c :
{port number}  
# Arguments for client.c :
{server address} {port number}

If you get a "Cannot connect" error after running the client, restart the server on another port as the one specified maybe busy.
